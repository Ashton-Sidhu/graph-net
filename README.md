# Graph-Net

Create a real time streaming graph of your network using Spark + Neo4j.

The purpose of the project is to create an open source, modular and scalable data pipeline to create a self updating graph of your network. It will provide insights on node to node connectivity, user and wholistic process maps to possibly identify anomalies, malicious behaviour or gain overall visibility of your network and users.

The project is divided into modular components that can be installed as required. If you already have one or more you don't have to reinstall it.

  - SIEM (Elastic Search)
  - Data Messaging (Kafka)
  - Data Streaming (Spark)
  - GraphDB (Neo4j)
